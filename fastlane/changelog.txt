New stuff:
- The SSE2 bit in cpuid is enabled! Enough instructions have been implemented for gcc, openssl, and node (mostly).
- Unknown errors will log a message instead of crashing the app
- The new filesystems management screen lets you export and import your data, and have multiple root filesystems so you can "dual boot"
- New switch to hide the extra row of keys when a hardware keyboard is connected
- procmail seems to work

Fixed bugs:
- ghc-alt-libc installation failing (it doesn't fail quite as much now)
- execve leaking a copy of its arguments
- ag (the silver searcher) and node hanging on exit, due to missing FUTEX_REQUEUE
- Scrolling not behaving sanely on iOS 11 and 12
- Ctrl-C in bash and fish not doing anything
- GPG being broken on alpine 3.12
- Ligatures not working
